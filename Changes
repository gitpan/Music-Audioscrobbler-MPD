Release Name: 0.03
============================
 * Name change for module.  Is now Music::Audioscrobbler::MPD.  Uninstall old
   version to facilitate change!
 * Repeating a song isn't a skip anymore (or rather skipping back a 
   scrobblable distance is not a skip)
 * Only submits a song <30 seconds long if it has an mbid.
 * Very basic test script for sanity.

Release Name: 0.02 12/3/07
============================
 * Fixed bug caused my Music::Tag returning non-integer values for "secs"
 * Along same lines, configure to not use Music::Tag secs values, but trust MPD

Release Name: 0.01  12/1/07
============================
 * Initial Release
 * Basic routines for scrobbling MPD.  Code from Music::Audioscrobbler merged 
   for now.
