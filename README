NAME
    Music::Audioscrobbler::MPD - Module providing routines to submit songs
    to last.fm from MPD.

DESCRIPTION
    Music::Audioscrobbler::MPD is a scrobbler for MPD. As of version .1,
    Music::Audioscrobbler::Submit is used to submit information to last.fm.

    All internal code is subject to change. See musicmpdscrobble for usage
    info.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

CONFIGURATION
    There is a sample config file under examples. A sample init file that I
    use for gentoo linux is there as well.

USE
    Edit the sample config file and copy to /etc/musicmpdscrobble.conf or
    ~/.musicmpdscrobble.conf

    Test your configuration by issue the command

        musicmpdscrobble --logfile=STDERR --monitor

    and playing some music.

    If it works, then the command

        musicmpdscrobble --daemonize 

    will run musicmpdscrobble as a daemon. Please see examples for a sample
    init script. If you make an init script for your distribution, please
    send it to me!

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

        Music::Audioscrobbler::Submit
        File::Spec
        Digest::MD5
        Encode
        IO::Socket
        IO::File
        Config::Options

    I strongly encourage you to also install my module

        Music::Tag

    This will allow you to read info from the file tag (such as the
    MusicBrainz ID).

    The version info in the Makefile is based on what I use. You can get
    away with older versions in many cases.

    Please see the documentation for musicmpdscrobble which is available
