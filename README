are available from CPAN (www.cpan.org).

To install this module type the following:

CONFIGURATION

There is a sample config file under examples.  A sample init file that I use for 
gentoo linux is there as well. 

USE

Edit the sample config file and copy to /etc/musicmpdscrobble.conf

Test your configuration by issue the command

musicmpdscrobble --logfile=STDERR --monitor

and playing some music.  

If it works, then the command

runs it as a daemon.

This will allow you to read info from the file tag.

The version info in the Makefile is based on what I use.  You can get
